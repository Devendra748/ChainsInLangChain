As the temperature increases, the peak of the radiation shifts to shorter wavelengths, resulting in a change in color from red to orange, yellow, white, and eventually blue at very high temperatures.\\n\\nBlack body radiation is a fundamental concept in physics and has been crucial in understanding various phenomena, such as the ultraviolet catastrophe and the development of quantum mechanics.
